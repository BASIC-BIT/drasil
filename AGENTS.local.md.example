# Local Operator Context (Not Committed)

This file is optional and intended to capture personal and machine-specific context that should
not live in the repo-wide `AGENTS.md`.

Copy to `AGENTS.local.md` (gitignored) and edit freely.

Rules:

- Never include secrets/tokens.
- Prefer describing paths and workflows over pasting large logs.

## Common local paths (optional)

- Workspace root: (fill in)
- Drasil base repo path: (fill in)
- Worktrees root path: (fill in)

## OpenCode permissions (optional)

If you keep worktrees outside the repo root, OpenCode may prompt for "external_directory" access.

- Put your preferred allowlist patterns here, or configure them in your global OpenCode config
  (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`).

## Personal preferences (optional)

- (fill in: commit style, test expectations, formatting preferences, etc.)
