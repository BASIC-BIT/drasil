# Verification Flow Deployment Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the deployment plan for the new verification flow system, which includes dedicated tables for verification events and admin actions. The deployment will be done in phases to ensure a smooth transition and minimize disruption.

## Prerequisites

1. Database schema changes are deployed (verification_events and admin_actions tables)
2. New repositories and services are implemented and tested
3. Feature flag system is in place
4. Migration script is tested in development environment

## Phase 1: Pre-Deployment (Day 0)

1. Backup the production database
2. Review and test all migration scripts
3. Verify feature flag functionality
4. Prepare rollback scripts
5. Update environment variables documentation

## Phase 2: Initial Deployment (Day 1)

1. Deploy code changes with feature flag disabled:

   - New tables and schema changes
   - New repositories and services
   - Updated UI components (disabled by default)
   - Feature flag implementation

2. Run database migrations:

   ```bash
   npx supabase db reset
   ```

3. Deploy the application code:

   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   npm install
   npm run build
   pm2 restart discord-bot
   ```

4. Verify deployment:
   - Check logs for any errors
   - Verify bot is running and responding
   - Confirm old verification flow still works

## Phase 3: Data Migration (Day 2)

1. Run the verification data migration:

   ```bash
   npm run migrate:verification
   ```

2. Verify migration success:

   - Check migration logs
   - Verify data integrity
   - Compare record counts
   - Sample test some migrated records

3. Create migration report:
   - Number of records migrated
   - Any failures or issues
   - Data validation results

## Phase 4: Gradual Rollout (Days 3-7)

1. Enable new verification flow for 10% of servers:

   ```bash
   # Update environment variable
   export USE_NEW_VERIFICATION_FLOW=true
   ```

2. Monitor for 24 hours:

   - Watch error rates
   - Check performance metrics
   - Gather user feedback

3. Gradually increase rollout:

   - Day 4: 25% of servers
   - Day 5: 50% of servers
   - Day 6: 75% of servers
   - Day 7: 100% of servers

4. At each stage:
   - Monitor error rates
   - Check performance
   - Gather feedback
   - Be prepared to rollback if issues arise

## Phase 5: Cleanup (Week 2)

1. Verify all servers are using new flow
2. Remove old verification code
3. Clean up deprecated fields
4. Update documentation

## Rollback Plan

If issues are detected during deployment:

1. Immediate Rollback:

   ```bash
   # Disable feature flag
   export USE_NEW_VERIFICATION_FLOW=false

   # Restart the bot
   pm2 restart discord-bot
   ```

2. Data Rollback (if needed):
   - Restore from database backup
   - Re-run migrations
   - Verify data integrity

## Monitoring

Monitor the following metrics during deployment:

1. Error Rates:

   - Verification failures
   - Database errors
   - API errors

2. Performance:

   - Response times
   - Database query times
   - Memory usage

3. User Impact:
   - Verification success rate
   - Admin feedback
   - User complaints

## Success Criteria

The deployment will be considered successful when:

1. All servers are using the new verification flow
2. Error rates are at or below pre-deployment levels
3. Performance metrics meet or exceed previous levels
4. No significant user complaints
5. All migrated data is verified accurate

## Support Plan

1. Dedicated team member monitoring deployment
2. Quick response plan for critical issues
3. Communication channels for user feedback
4. Documentation for common issues and solutions

## Timeline Summary

- Day 0: Pre-deployment preparations
- Day 1: Initial code deployment
- Day 2: Data migration
- Days 3-7: Gradual rollout
- Week 2: Cleanup and monitoring
- Week 3: Project completion review

## Communication Plan

1. Pre-deployment:

   - Notify all server admins
   - Document expected changes
   - Provide feedback channels

2. During deployment:

   - Regular status updates
   - Immediate notification of issues
   - Clear escalation path

3. Post-deployment:
   - Success announcement
   - Feature documentation
   - Feedback collection

## Documentation Updates

1. Update user documentation:

   - New verification flow features
   - Admin interface changes
   - New commands or options

2. Update technical documentation:
   - Architecture changes
   - Database schema
   - API changes
   - Configuration options
