# Future Features

## /scan
Scan all existing users in the server for suspcious accounts
Present a list to the user, allow them to confirm before creating all those verification events

## /interogate \[user\] (probably a better name lol)
Open a verification event for a user manually

## /setupverification
Go through a wizard to set up the verificaiton channel, admin channel, and restriction role

## Ban/Verification/Reopen confirmation
Have users confirm their actions for verification and banning, and reopening cases

## Captcha
Have the user complete a captcha as part of the verification process.  This could be an automatic DM to the user, probably configurable.

## Server Customizable Thread Verification Message
Right now the message sent in the thread to verify the user is static - it'd be ideal if this were customizable by the user. MOST ideally, in a web server that the user can verify with discord with.

## Configuration website
This is a MONSTEROUSLY big feature, and shouldn't be worked on until everything else is airtight.
Make a website for configuring the bot, verifying users, etc.
