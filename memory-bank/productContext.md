# Discord Anti-Spam Bot: Product Context

## Core Functionality

### User Detection Events

- **Immediate check** upon user joining server
- **Initial full-server scan** upon bot onboarding
- **Periodic scans** of existing users (interval configurable)
- **Triggered scans** by suspicious user behavior (rapid message sending, excessive DMs)

### AI Detection Data Points

- Discord username and discriminator
- Nickname (analysis for pronounceability, special characters)
- Profile description, pronouns, bio
- External connections (Spotify, Steam, Xbox, etc.)
- Profile picture and banner image analysis
- Account creation date, server join date
- Mutual server information (when available)

### Detection Outcomes

- Binary classification (SUSPICIOUS or OK)
- Confidence score clearly communicated in admin summaries (Low/Medium/High)
- Detailed reasons for flagging

## Problem Statement

Discord servers face persistent challenges with spam, scams, and malicious users. Current solutions often:

1. React **after** harm has occurred, when users have already been exposed to scams
2. Rely solely on basic keyword filtering or message frequency, which spammers easily evade
3. Create excessive friction for legitimate users through heavy-handed verification
4. Require significant manual moderation effort, overwhelming server administrators

This creates an environment where:

- Users may be exposed to scams before moderators can intervene
- Server administrators spend excessive time on moderation
- Legitimate users face frustrating verification processes
- Communities struggle to maintain a safe, welcoming atmosphere

## Solution Overview

Our Discord Anti-Spam Bot addresses these challenges through:

### 1. Proactive Detection

Rather than waiting for obvious spam patterns, the bot uses GPT-powered analysis to identify suspicious accounts based on subtle patterns, even before they've broken obvious rules. This proactive approach allows us to:

1. Analyze subtle patterns or suspicious profiles
2. Make informed decisions on user authenticity
3. Intervene **before** harm occurs

The implementation includes:

- **New Join Analysis**: Every new member is automatically analyzed by GPT
- **Account Age Evaluation**: Recently created accounts receive extra scrutiny
- **Profile Characteristic Analysis**: Username patterns, discriminators, and nicknames are evaluated
- **Message Content Analysis**: First messages from new users are carefully examined
- **Early Restriction**: Suspicious users are restricted before they can spam

### 2. Hybrid Detection Approach

The bot combines:

- **Fast heuristic checks**:

  - Message frequency tracking (>5 messages in 10 seconds)
  - Suspicious keyword detection (nitro scam, free discord nitro, etc.)
  - Pattern matching for common spam formats

- **Sophisticated GPT analysis**:

  - User profile evaluation with account age and join date
  - Message content analysis for subtle spam indicators
  - Few-shot learning with categorized examples
  - Confidence scoring for decision transparency

- **Smart Orchestration**:
  - Heuristics first for efficiency
  - GPT for borderline cases or new users
  - Combined scoring system for final decisions
  - Reason tracking for admin transparency

This multi-layered approach provides both speed and accuracy.

### 3. Streamlined Verification

For flagged users, the bot implements a structured verification process:

- **Automatically assigns a restricted role** limiting server access
- **Creates dedicated verification threads** in a private channel
- **Sends verification instructions** to guide legitimate users
- **Maintains privacy** by isolating verification conversations
- **Preserves context** by keeping verification threads organized
- **Prompts users** with simple verification questions:
  - "How did you find our community?"
  - "What interests you here?"

### 4. Admin-Friendly Interface

Administrators receive:

- **Detailed notification embeds** with:

  - User profile information and avatar
  - Account creation and join timestamps (both absolute and relative)
  - Detection confidence level (Low/Medium/High)
  - Bullet-pointed reasons for flagging
  - Trigger source (message content or join event)

- **Interactive buttons** for one-click actions:

  - Verify User (removes restricted role)
  - Ban User (removes from server)
  - Create Thread (for verification conversation)

- **Action logging** directly in notification messages:
  - Records which admin took what action
  - Includes timestamps for accountability
  - Links to verification threads when created
  - Maintains complete history in original message
