## Files That Can Be Removed from docs/

The following files in the `docs` directory can now be removed as their information has been consolidated into the `memory-bank` files:

1. CODEBASE_MAP.md - Content merged into systemPatterns.md
2. prompt_plan.md - Implementation details extracted to activeContext.md and systemPatterns.md
3. spam_detection_guide.md - Strategies merged into techContext.md
4. spam_detection_spec.md - Content merged into productContext.md and techContext.md
5. spec.md - Content merged into projectbrief.md and productContext.md
6. tech_spec.md - Content merged into techContext.md
7. testing-strategy.md - Content merged into testing-best-practices.md
8. todo.md - Content merged into progress.md
9. database/ directory - Content moved to database-implementation.md

## Next Steps

1. Verify that all critical information has been preserved in the memory-bank files
2. Remove the unnecessary files from the docs/ directory
3. Update any references to the old documentation files
4. Consider adding cross-references between memory-bank files for better navigation
