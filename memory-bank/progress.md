# Discord Anti-Spam Bot: Progress Tracker

## Project Status Overview

The Discord Anti-Spam Bot is currently in active development with several key components implemented and functioning. The architecture is being actively refactored towards a more robust Event-Driven Architecture (EDA). This document tracks the current state of the project, what's working, and what remains to be built.

## Recently Completed

### Database Schema Consolidation

- ✅ Combined all migrations into single initial schema file
  - Simplified database setup and management
  - Clear starting point for schema structure
  - Proper foreign key relationships
  - Comprehensive indexing strategy
  - Row Level Security implementation
  - Helper functions for common operations
  - Clear documentation and comments

### Service Architecture Improvements

- ✅ Moved entity existence checks to SecurityActionService
  - Ensures early verification of required entities
  - Single point of responsibility for entity creation
  - Proper error handling and logging
  - Prevents cascading errors
- ✅ Simplified UserReputationService
  - Focused solely on reputation management
  - Removed entity management responsibilities
  - Cleaner, more maintainable code
  - Better adherence to Single Responsibility Principle
- ✅ Streamlined DetectionOrchestrator
  - Focused purely on detection logic
  - Removed user/reputation management code (prior to EDA refactor)
  - Clearer responsibility boundaries
  - Improved maintainability

### Service Flow Improvements (EDA Refactoring)

- ✅ **Event-Driven Architecture Refactoring (Phase 1 & 2 - Core Side Effects)**:
  - Implemented `EventBus` and core event definitions (`VerificationStarted`, `UserVerified`, `UserBanned`).
  - Refactored `SecurityActionService` and `UserModerationService` to publish result events.
  - Created and integrated subscribers (`RestrictionSubscriber`, `NotificationSubscriber`, `RoleUpdateSubscriber`, `ActionLogSubscriber`, `ServerMemberStatusSubscriber`) to handle side effects triggered by result events.
  - Decoupled core workflows (suspicious user handling, verification, banning).
- ✅ **Event-Driven Architecture Refactoring (Phase 3 - Detection & Moderation Triggers)**:
  - Refactored `DetectionOrchestrator` to create `DetectionEvent` records & return ID.
  - Refactored `EventHandler` to publish `UserDetectedSuspicious` event.
  - Created `DetectionResultHandlerSubscriber` to handle `UserDetectedSuspicious` and call `SecurityActionService`.
  - Defined and handled `AdditionalSuspicionDetected` event via `NotificationSubscriber`.
  - Defined and handled `VerificationReopened` event via `VerificationReopenSubscriber`.
  - Defined `AdminVerifyUserRequested` & `AdminBanUserRequested` events.
  - Refactored `InteractionHandler` & `CommandHandler` to publish admin request events.
  - Refactored `UserModerationService` to subscribe to admin request events.
- ✅ Better error handling and propagation within core services.
- ✅ Improved logging and debugging capabilities.
- ✅ Clearer service boundaries and responsibilities established through event decoupling.
- ✅ **Eager Subscriber Loading**: Implemented `SubscriberInitializer` pattern to ensure event subscribers are instantiated eagerly during bootstrap, fixing issues with missed events due to lazy loading.

## What Works

## Current Metrics

### Code Coverage

- Unit tests: Present for some core services and repositories. Needs significant expansion, especially for repositories and event flows.
- Integration tests: Limited (`Bot.integration.test.ts`, `container.integration.test.ts`). Needs expansion for EDA flows.
- End-to-end tests: Not implemented.

### Performance

- Not measured.

### Stability

- Core functionality: Implemented with error handling. EDA refactoring aims to improve robustness.
- Edge cases: Some handling implemented, more needed.
- Error handling: Comprehensive in most areas, needs review within event subscriber chains.
- Graceful degradation: Implemented for critical services.

## Known Issues

1.  **Test Coverage**: Significantly lacking, especially for repositories and new event-driven flows.
2.  **Button Interaction Timeout**: Buttons expire after 15 minutes without visual indication.
3.  **GPT API Usage**: No rate limiting or sophisticated error handling/retry logic.
4.  **Large Server Performance**: Not tested under high load.
5.  **Configuration Management**: No web UI, limited validation.
6.  **Interaction Replies**: No standardized way for subscribers to reply to the original interaction (e.g., confirm ban processed).
7.  **Error Handling in Subscribers**: Need strategy for handling errors within subscriber chains.
8.  **`VerificationService` Role**: Needs review for potential redundancy.
9.  **History Button Logic**: Currently calls repositories directly from handler (needs refactor).

## Next Milestone Goals

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)

1.  **Testing**: Add integration tests for core EDA flows (`UserDetectedSuspicious`, `AdminVerifyUserRequested`, `AdminBanUserRequested`). Add repository tests using Prisma mocking.
2.  **Documentation**: Complete Memory Bank updates (`progress.md`, README, guides). Document schema and migration process.
3.  **Alpha Polish**: Address button timeouts, improve admin feedback (potentially `InteractionReplySubscriber`). Implement basic user reputation columns/logic.

### Medium-term (1-2 Months)

1.  Enhance cross-server reputation system.
2.  Create basic web dashboard for configuration.
3.  Implement performance monitoring and optimization (rate limiting, etc.).
4.  Develop deployment automation and monitoring.

### Long-term (3+ Months)

1.  Develop custom fine-tuned AI model.
2.  Create comprehensive analytics and reporting.
3.  Implement advanced behavioral detection.
4.  Add payment integration for premium features.
5.  Build cross-platform integration capabilities.
