   - Potential for quota exhaustion in high-traffic servers
   - No fallback for API outages beyond defaulting to "OK"

4. **Large Server Performance**:

   - Not tested with very large servers (10,000+ members)
   - Potential memory issues with message history tracking
   - Database connection limits not configured

5. **Configuration Management** (IMPROVED):

   - ✅ Implemented `/config` command for server-specific settings
   - ✅ Removed dependency on environment variables for server configuration
   - ✅ Added database persistence for configuration values
   - No web interface for configuration management
   - Limited validation of configuration values

6. **Database Implementation**:
   - Initial schema created but not fully utilized
   - User and server member repositories not implemented
   - No data migration strategy for schema changes
