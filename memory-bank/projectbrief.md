# Discord Anti-Spam Bot: Project Brief

## Project Overview

This project is an AI-powered Discord bot designed to prevent spam and manage user verification using a combination of heuristic analysis and GPT-powered detection. The bot proactively identifies suspicious users before they can cause harm, provides streamlined moderation tools, and implements an efficient verification system to help server administrators maintain a clean and safe environment.

## Core Objectives

1. **Proactive Spam Detection**:

   - Identify suspicious accounts upon joining, before they can spam
   - Analyze user profiles for suspicious patterns
   - Evaluate account age and join timing
   - Detect subtle indicators of malicious intent

2. **Hybrid Detection Approach**:

   - Combine fast heuristic rules for immediate detection
   - Leverage GPT-powered analysis for nuanced understanding
   - Implement smart orchestration between approaches
   - Provide confidence levels and reason tracking

3. **Streamlined Moderation**:

   - Deliver clear, actionable notifications to administrators
   - Offer one-click moderation actions via interactive buttons
   - Implement dedicated verification channels and threads
   - Track moderation actions for accountability

4. **Minimal Friction**:
   - Target restrictions only to suspicious users
   - Provide clear verification paths for legitimate users
   - Implement cross-server reputation for established users
   - Balance security with user experience

## Key Features

- **User Detection Events**:

  - Immediate check upon user joining server
  - Initial full-server scan upon bot onboarding
  - Periodic scans of existing users (interval configurable)
  - Triggered scans by suspicious user behavior

- **AI-Powered Analysis**:

  - GPT-4o-mini integration for sophisticated detection
  - User profile evaluation with account age analysis
  - Message content analysis for spam patterns
  - Few-shot learning with categorized examples
  - Confidence scoring for decision transparency

- **Heuristic Checks**:

  - Message frequency monitoring (>5 messages in 10 seconds)
  - Suspicious keyword detection (nitro scam, free discord nitro, etc.)
  - Pattern matching for common spam formats
  - Efficient message history tracking

- **Verification System**:

  - Automatic restricted role assignment
  - Dedicated verification channel with proper permissions
  - Private threads for individual verification cases
  - Clear verification instructions and process

- **Admin Interface**:

  - Detailed notification embeds with user information
    - Username and avatar
    - AI suspicion confidence (Low/Medium/High)
    - Trigger source (message content or join event)
    - Bullet-pointed reasons for flagging
  - Interactive buttons for one-click moderation actions
  - Action logging directly in notification messages
  - Slash commands for additional control

- **Configuration System**:

  - Server-specific settings with database persistence
  - Caching for performance optimization
  - Default configurations with environment fallbacks
  - Global settings for application-wide controls

- **Cross-Server Intelligence** (Planned):

  - User tracking across multiple servers
  - Global reputation scoring system
  - Trust network for server verification
  - Privacy controls for data sharing

- **Dependency Injection with InversifyJS**:
  - Interface-based design for all services and repositories
  - Centralized container configuration
  - Type symbols for dependency identification
  - Simplified testing with mockable dependencies

## Target Users
