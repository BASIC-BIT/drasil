# Discord Anti-Spam Bot: Project Brief

## Project Overview

This project is an AI-powered Discord bot designed to prevent spam and manage user verification using a combination of heuristic analysis and GPT-powered detection. The bot proactively identifies suspicious users before they can cause harm, provides streamlined moderation tools, and implements an efficient verification system to help server administrators maintain a clean and safe environment.

## Core Objectives

1. **Proactive Spam Detection**: 
   - Identify suspicious accounts upon joining, before they can spam
   - Analyze user profiles for suspicious patterns
   - Evaluate account age and join timing
   - Detect subtle indicators of malicious intent

2. **Hybrid Detection Approach**: 
   - Combine fast heuristic rules for immediate detection
   - Leverage GPT-powered analysis for nuanced understanding
   - Implement smart orchestration between approaches
   - Provide confidence levels and reason tracking

3. **Streamlined Moderation**: 
   - Deliver clear, actionable notifications to administrators
   - Offer one-click moderation actions via interactive buttons
   - Implement dedicated verification channels and threads
   - Track moderation actions for accountability

4. **Minimal Friction**: 
   - Target restrictions only to suspicious users
   - Provide clear verification paths for legitimate users
   - Implement cross-server reputation for established users
   - Balance security with user experience

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis**:
  - GPT-4o-mini integration for sophisticated detection
  - User profile evaluation with account age analysis
  - Message content analysis for spam patterns
  - Few-shot learning with categorized examples
  - Confidence scoring for decision transparency

- **Heuristic Checks**:
  - Message frequency monitoring (>5 messages in 10 seconds)
  - Suspicious keyword detection (nitro scam, free discord nitro, etc.)
  - Pattern matching for common spam formats
  - Efficient message history tracking

- **Verification System**:
  - Automatic restricted role assignment
  - Dedicated verification channel with proper permissions
  - Private threads for individual verification cases
  - Clear verification instructions and process

- **Admin Interface**:
  - Detailed notification embeds with user information
  - Interactive buttons for one-click moderation actions
  - Action logging directly in notification messages
  - Slash commands for additional control

- **Configuration System**:
  - Server-specific settings with database persistence
  - Caching for performance optimization
  - Default configurations with environment fallbacks
  - Global settings for application-wide controls

- **Cross-Server Intelligence** (Planned):
  - User tracking across multiple servers
  - Global reputation scoring system
  - Trust network for server verification
  - Privacy controls for data sharing

## Target Users

- **Primary**: Discord server administrators and moderators who:
  - Manage medium to large communities (500+ members)
  - Deal with frequent spam or scam attempts
  - Have limited time for manual moderation
  - Need reliable, low-maintenance protection

- **Secondary**: Communities with specific concerns:
  - Public servers vulnerable to raid attacks
  - Servers with sensitive discussions
  - Communities with verification requirements
  - Groups with limited moderation resources

- **Tertiary**: Official and brand servers:
  - Public-facing product communities
  - Support servers for software and services
  - Event-based communities with fluctuating membership
  - Multi-server networks with shared moderation

## Success Criteria

1. **Effectiveness**:
   - Significantly reduced spam incidents in protected servers
   - Proactive prevention rather than reactive cleanup
   - Successful identification of subtle spam patterns
   - Adaptability to evolving spam techniques

2. **Accuracy**:
   - Low false-positive rate for legitimate users
   - High confidence in AI-powered detection
   - Clear explanation of detection reasons
   - Continuous improvement through feedback

3. **Usability**:
   - Positive feedback from server administrators
   - Intuitive interface with minimal learning curve
   - Efficient verification process for flagged users
   - Reduced moderation workload for administrators

4. **Performance**:
   - Scalable operation across multiple servers
   - Efficient resource utilization
   - Responsive moderation actions
   - Reliable uptime and stability

5. **Technical Quality**:
   - Well-structured, maintainable codebase
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Thorough test coverage
   - Clear documentation
