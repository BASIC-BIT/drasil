# Discord Anti-Spam Bot: Active Context

## Current Development Focus

The project is currently focused on implementing the core functionality of the Discord Anti-Spam Bot, with recent work on database schema consolidation and service architecture improvements.

### Things on the developers mind right now

- Our service architecture is very confusing. We should solidify on very specific approaches about how services call other services...
- Considering when, in the service layer, we should call another service vs a repository... Handling side effects and such

## Current Architecture State

The system uses InversifyJS for dependency injection and is transitioning towards an Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) for decoupling core workflows. Key components include:

1. **Dependency Injection with InversifyJS**:

   - Central container configuration in `src/di/container.ts`
   - Symbol definitions in `src/di/symbols.ts`
   - Interfaces for all services and repositories
   - `@injectable()` decorators on all service and repository classes
   - `@inject()` decorators for constructor parameters
   - Singleton scope for most services and repositories
   - Testable architecture with mock injections

2. **Bot Core (Bot.ts)**:

   - Main orchestrator class implementing IBot interface
   - Event handling for Discord interactions
   - Service initialization through dependency injection
   - Command registration and processing
   - Button interaction handling
   - Server initialization and management

3. **Detection Services**:

   - **HeuristicService**: Fast, rule-based detection
   - **GPTService**: AI-powered deep analysis
   - **DetectionOrchestrator**: Combines both approaches with smart routing

4. **User Management**:

   - **RoleManager**: Restricted role assignment and removal
   - **NotificationManager**: Admin notifications and verification threads
   - **UserService**: Handles user operations across servers
   - **VerificationService**: Manages verification lifecycle and status tracking
   - **AdminActionService**: Records and tracks admin moderation actions
   - **UserModerationService**: Coordinates user restriction and verification workflows

5. **Configuration**:

   - **ConfigService**: Server-specific settings with caching
   - **GlobalConfig**: Application-wide settings
   - **Server Configuration Command**:
     - `/config` command for updating server settings
     - Supports updating restricted_role_id, admin_channel_id, verification_channel_id, admin_notification_role_id
     - Requires administrator permissions
     - Persists settings in database
     - Updates services in real-time
     - Eliminates need for environment variables

6. **Data Access (Prisma)**:
   - **Repository Pattern**: Abstraction for data operations, implemented using Prisma Client.
   - **Prisma Client**: ORM managing database connections and queries to Supabase PostgreSQL.
   - **Server Configuration**: Persistent storage for settings via `ServerRepository`.
   - **User Repository**: Manages Discord users across servers.
   - **Server Member Repository**: Manages user data in specific servers.
   - **Detection/Verification/Admin Repositories**: Manage related event/action data.
7. **Eventing System**:
   - **EventBus**: Central singleton for publishing and subscribing to internal events.
   - **Events**: Strongly-typed definitions for events and payloads (`src/events/events.ts`).
   - **Subscribers**: Dedicated classes handling side effects triggered by events (`src/events/subscribers/`).


## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Current Technical Decisions

1. **Service Responsibility Separation**:

   - SecurityActionService now handles entity existence verification
   - Early entity verification ensures data consistency
   - UserReputationService focused purely on reputation management
   - DetectionOrchestrator focused purely on detection logic
   - Clear, unidirectional flow: Detection ‚Üí Security Action ‚Üí Reputation

2. **Dependency Injection Implementation**:

   - Using InversifyJS for IoC container management
   - Interfaces defined for all injectable components
   - Symbol-based dependency resolution
   - Singleton scope for repositories and stateful services
   - Transient scope for stateless services
   - External dependency injection (Discord client, OpenAI, Supabase)
   - Test utilities for container-based testing

3. **GPT Usage Optimization**:

   - Using gpt-4o-mini model for improved accuracy with reasonable cost
   - Selective invocation strategy:
     - Always use for new server joins
     - Use for new accounts' first messages
     - Use for borderline suspicious messages from established users
     - Skip for clearly OK or clearly suspicious messages (based on heuristics)
   - Structured few-shot examples in four categories:
     - Clearly suspicious (obvious spam/scam)
     - Borderline suspicious (subtle but should be flagged)
     - Borderline normal (unusual but should be OK)
     - Clearly normal (obviously legitimate users)
   - Low temperature (0.3) for more consistent responses
   - Limited token usage (max_tokens: 50) for efficiency

4. **Admin Notification Format**:

   - Confidence level display:
     - üü¢ Low (0-40%)
     - üü° Medium (41-70%)
     - üî¥ High (71-100%)
   - Enhanced timestamp displays:
     - Full timestamp (e.g., March 15, 2023 3:45 PM)
     - Relative Discord timestamp (e.g., "2 days ago")
   - Trigger information:
     - Message content with link if available
     - "Flagged upon joining server" for join events
   - Bullet-point formatting for detection reasons
   - Interactive buttons for admin actions:
     - Verify User (success style)
     - Ban User (danger style)
     - Create Thread (primary style)
   - Action logging directly in notification messages:
     - Admin attribution
     - Timestamps for accountability
     - Links to verification threads when applicable
     - Maintains complete history in original message

5. **Verification Channel Structure**:

   - Dedicated channel with specific permissions:
     - Everyone: No access (deny ViewChannel)
     - Restricted role: Can view and send messages
     - Bot: Full access for management
     - Admin roles: Full access
   - Private threads for individual verification cases
   - Initial message with verification instructions
   - Automatic thread creation for flagged new joins
   - Manual thread creation via button or command

6. **Database Error Handling**:

   - Specific handling for PostgrestError code 'PGRST116' (no rows found)
   - Treating "not found" cases as valid null returns rather than errors
   - Careful data preparation before database operations
   - Excluding non-UUID formatted IDs when creating new records
   - Consistent error propagation with context using RepositoryError

7. **Server Configuration Management**:

   - Database-stored configuration values instead of environment variables
   - Server-specific settings with `/config` command
   - Real-time service updates when configuration changes
   - Cache-first approach with database fallback
   - Type-safe configuration access

8. **Repository Testing Strategy**:

   - **Current Status**: Repository unit tests are currently missing.
   - **Future Strategy**: Implement unit tests using Prisma mocking strategies (e.g., `jest-mock-extended`).
   - Test both success and error paths.
   - Use InversifyJS test utilities (once implemented/found) for dependency injection mocking.

9. **Repository Pattern Implementation (Prisma)**:
   - Repositories implement interfaces (e.g., `IServerRepository`).
   - Repositories inject and use `PrismaClient`.
   - Clear separation of concerns maintained.
   - Error handling uses `RepositoryError` wrapper around Prisma errors.
10. **Event-Driven Flow**:
   - Core actions (user restriction, notification, role updates, status changes, logging) are triggered by events like `VerificationStarted`, `UserVerified`, `UserBanned`.
   - Services publish events; dedicated subscribers handle the resulting side effects.

### Open Questions & Considerations

1. **Database Schema Design**:

   - Initial schema created with three main tables:
     - servers: Guild configuration storage (fully implemented with repository)
     - users: Cross-server user tracking (schema created but repository not implemented)

   - Need to implement repositories for users and server_members
   - Need to design queries for cross-server reputation lookup
   - Consider indexing strategy for performance
   - Plan for data retention and pruning

2. **Performance Optimization**:

   - Server configuration caching implemented
   - Need to implement rate limiting for GPT API calls
   - Consider message queue for high-traffic servers
   - Evaluate memory usage for message history tracking
   - Plan for database connection pooling
   - Consider sharding for very large bot installations

3. **Deployment Strategy**:
   - Need to decide between VPS and serverless hosting
   - Evaluate Docker containerization benefits
   - Plan for environment variable management in production
   - Consider monitoring and alerting solutions
   - Design backup and recovery procedures
   - Plan for zero-downtime updates

   - Current approach uses a hybrid system:
     - Fast heuristics for obvious cases
     - GPT for nuanced analysis
     - Confidence scoring for transparency
   - Need to tune thresholds based on real-world usage
   - Need to collect feedback on false positives/negatives
   - Need to adapt to evolving spam techniques

2. **Discord API Limitations**:

   - Button interactions expire after 15 minutes
   - Gateway connection requirements for certain events
   - Rate limits for high-traffic operations
   - Slash command registration delays
   - Permission management complexity

3. **Cost Management**:

   - Selective GPT usage strategy implemented
   - Need to monitor and optimize token usage
   - Need to evaluate hosting options for cost-efficiency
   - Need to plan for scaling with increased adoption
   - Consider premium tier options for sustainability

4. **Database Error Handling and Entity Relationships**:

   - Improved error handling for Supabase operations

   - Clear separation of concerns between repositories
   - Consistent pattern for entity creation and relationships
   - Proper debugging with detailed logging
   - Detailed error messages with context for troubleshooting

5. **InversifyJS Testing Best Practices**:

   - **Private Property Access**: Use proper type assertions with `(as any)` for accessing private properties instead of bracket notation which causes TypeScript errors.
   - **Dynamic Values**: Use `expect.any(String)` or `expect.any(Date)` for dynamically generated fields like timestamps rather than exact values.
   - **Mock Implementation**: Create proper mock implementations that match the interface, especially for complex objects with nested properties.
   - **Container Configuration**: Ensure all dependencies are properly bound in the test container, including external services like SupabaseClient.
   - **Constructor Parameters**: Ensure mock parameters match the implementation's constructor signature exactly, especially when using overloaded constructors.
   - **Avoiding Direct Property Access**: Prefer testing through public methods rather than accessing private properties directly in tests.
   - **Code Quality**: Remove unused imports and variables to avoid lint errors and improve test readability.
   - **Error Scenario Testing**: Properly set up mocks for error scenarios to ensure error propagation is tested correctly.
   - **Custom Assertions**: Use extension methods and custom matchers for cleaner test assertions.
   - **Test Isolation**: Ensure proper cleanup between tests using `afterEach` and `jest.clearAllMocks()` to prevent test interference.

6. **Performance Optimization for Alpha Release**:
   - Need to implement rate limiting for OpenAI API calls
   - Message queue system needed for high-traffic servers
   - Memory usage optimization for message history tracking
   - Database connection pooling configuration
   - Performance metrics and monitoring implementation
   - Stress testing needed to identify bottlenecks
   - Caching strategy refinement for server configurations
