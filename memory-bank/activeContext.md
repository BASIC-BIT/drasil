# Discord Anti-Spam Bot: Active Context

## Current Development Focus

The project is currently focused on solidifying the internal architecture using an Event-Driven approach to decouple services and improve maintainability.

### Things on the developers mind right now

- Ensuring the event flows cover all necessary side effects.
- Planning the next steps: testing the new event flows or continuing refactoring.
- Updating documentation to accurately reflect the new architecture.

## Current Architecture State

The system uses InversifyJS for dependency injection and an Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) for decoupling core workflows. Key components include:

1.  **Dependency Injection with InversifyJS**:

    - Central container configuration in `src/di/container.ts`
    - Symbol definitions in `src/di/symbols.ts`
    - Interfaces for all services and repositories
    - `@injectable()` decorators on all service and repository classes
    - `@inject()` decorators for constructor parameters
    - Singleton scope for most services, repositories, and subscribers
    - Testable architecture with mock injections

2.  **Bot Core (Bot.ts & Controllers)**:

    - `Bot.ts`: Main entry point, logs into Discord, delegates to `EventHandler`.
    - `EventHandler.ts`: Listens for Discord gateway events (`messageCreate`, `guildMemberAdd`), performs initial processing (e.g., calls `DetectionOrchestrator`), and publishes internal events (e.g., `UserDetectedSuspicious`).
    - `CommandHandler.ts`: Handles slash commands, publishes request events (e.g., `AdminBanUserRequested`).
    - `InteractionHandler.ts`: Handles button interactions, publishes request events (e.g., `AdminVerifyUserRequested`).

3.  **Detection Services**:

    - **HeuristicService**: Fast, rule-based detection.
    - **GPTService**: AI-powered deep analysis.
    - **DetectionOrchestrator**: Combines both approaches, creates `DetectionEvent` record, returns `DetectionResult` with `detectionEventId`.

4.  **User Management & Moderation Services**:

    - **RoleManager**: Manages restricted role assignment/removal (called by subscribers).
    - **NotificationManager**: Formats/sends admin notifications, logs actions (called by subscribers).
    - **ThreadManager**: Manages verification threads (called by subscribers).
    - **UserService**: Handles user operations across servers (primarily via repositories).
    - **VerificationService**: (Potentially needs refactoring/removal).
    - **AdminActionService**: Records admin actions, publishes `AdminActionRecorded`.
    - **UserModerationService**: Subscribes to `Admin...Requested` events, executes core verify/ban logic, publishes `UserVerified`/`UserBanned` events. Contains `restrictUser` logic (called by `RestrictionSubscriber`).
    - **SecurityActionService**: Subscribes to `UserDetectedSuspicious`, initiates verification (`VerificationStarted` event) or updates (`AdditionalSuspicionDetected` event). Handles `VerificationReopened` event.

5.  **Configuration**:

    - **ConfigService**: Server-specific settings with caching.
    - **GlobalConfig**: Application-wide settings.
    - **Server Configuration Command**: `/config` command handled by `CommandHandler`.

6.  **Data Access (Prisma)**:

    - **Repository Pattern**: Abstraction for data operations using Prisma Client.
    - **Prisma Client**: ORM managing database connections and queries.
    - Repositories for `servers`, `users`, `server_members`, `detection_events`, `verification_events`, `admin_actions`.

7.  **Eventing System**:
    - **EventBus**: Central singleton (`EventEmitter`) for pub/sub.
    - **Events**: Strongly-typed definitions (`src/events/events.ts`). Includes detection events, verification lifecycle events, admin request events, and result events.
    - **Subscribers**: Dedicated classes handling side effects (`src/events/subscribers/`). Key flows:
      - `UserDetectedSuspicious` -> `DetectionResultHandlerSubscriber` -> `SecurityActionService` -> (`VerificationStarted` or `AdditionalSuspicionDetected`)
      - `VerificationStarted` -> `RestrictionSubscriber`, `NotificationSubscriber`
      - `AdditionalSuspicionDetected` -> `NotificationSubscriber`
      - `AdminVerifyUserRequested` -> `UserModerationService` -> `UserVerified`
      - `AdminBanUserRequested` -> `UserModerationService` -> `UserBanned`
      - `UserVerified` -> `RoleUpdateSubscriber`, `ActionLogSubscriber`, `ServerMemberStatusSubscriber`
      - `UserBanned` -> `ActionLogSubscriber`, `ServerMemberStatusSubscriber`
      - `VerificationReopened` -> `VerificationReopenSubscriber` (handles thread, restriction, logging)

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Current Technical Decisions

1.  **Service Responsibility Separation**: Further refined through EDA. Detection is separate from action initiation, which is separate from side effect handling.
2.  **Dependency Injection Implementation**: Stable with InversifyJS.
3.  **GPT Usage Optimization**: Strategy remains the same.
4.  **Admin Notification Format**: Strategy remains the same.
5.  **Verification Channel Structure**: Strategy remains the same.
6.  **Database Error Handling**: Strategy remains the same.
7.  **Server Configuration Management**: Stable with `/config` command and database persistence.
8.  **Repository Testing Strategy**: Still pending implementation.
9.  **Repository Pattern Implementation (Prisma)**: Stable.
10. **Event-Driven Flow**: Expanded significantly.
    - Detection results trigger `UserDetectedSuspicious`.
    - Security actions initiate `VerificationStarted` or `AdditionalSuspicionDetected`.
    - Admin commands/buttons trigger `Admin...Requested` events.
    - Core service logic (verify/ban) publishes result events (`UserVerified`, `UserBanned`).
    - Side effects (role changes, notifications, logging, status updates) handled by dedicated subscribers reacting to result events.

### Open Questions & Considerations

1.  **Database Schema Design**: Still need to fully implement and utilize `users` and `server_members` for cross-server features.
2.  **Performance Optimization**: Rate limiting, potential queuing still needed.
3.  **Deployment Strategy**: Still pending.
4.  **Interaction Replies**: How should subscribers handle replying to interactions (e.g., confirming a ban request was processed)? A dedicated `InteractionReplySubscriber` might be needed.
5.  **Error Handling in Event Flows**: Need robust error handling within subscribers. What happens if a subscriber fails? Retry logic? Dead-letter queue?
6.  **`VerificationService` Role**: Review if this service is still needed or if its logic can be fully absorbed by repositories/subscribers.
