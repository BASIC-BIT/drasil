   - Service initialization and coordination
   - Command registration and processing
   - Button interaction handling
   - Server initialization and management

2. **Detection Services**:

   - **GPTService**: AI-powered deep analysis
   - **DetectionOrchestrator**: Combines both approaches with smart routing

3. **User Management**:

   - **RoleManager**: Restricted role assignment and removal
   - **NotificationManager**: Admin notifications and verification threads

4. **Configuration**:

   - **ConfigService**: Server-specific settings with caching
   - **GlobalConfig**: Application-wide settings
   - **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration

5. **Data Access**:
   - **Repository Pattern**: Abstraction for data operations
   - **Supabase Integration**: PostgreSQL database access
   - **Server Configuration**: Persistent storage for settings

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Current Technical Decisions

1. **GPT Usage Optimization**:

   - Using gpt-4o-mini model for improved accuracy with reasonable cost
   - Selective invocation strategy:
     - Always use for new server joins
     - Use for new accounts' first messages
     - Use for borderline suspicious messages from established users
     - Skip for clearly OK or clearly suspicious messages (based on heuristics)
   - Structured few-shot examples in four categories:
     - Clearly suspicious (obvious spam/scam)
     - Borderline suspicious (subtle but should be flagged)
     - Borderline normal (unusual but should be OK)
     - Clearly normal (obviously legitimate users)
   - Low temperature (0.3) for more consistent responses
   - Limited token usage (max_tokens: 50) for efficiency

2. **Admin Notification Format**:

   - Confidence level display:
     - üü¢ Low (0-40%)
     - üü° Medium (41-70%)
     - üî¥ High (71-100%)
   - Enhanced timestamp displays:
     - Full timestamp (e.g., March 15, 2023 3:45 PM)
     - Relative Discord timestamp (e.g., "2 days ago")
   - Trigger information:
     - Message content with link if available
     - "Flagged upon joining server" for join events
   - Bullet-point formatting for detection reasons
   - Interactive buttons for admin actions:
     - Verify User (success style)
     - Ban User (danger style)
     - Create Thread (primary style)
   - Action logging directly in notification messages:
     - Admin attribution
     - Timestamp of action
     - Thread links when applicable

3. **Verification Channel Structure**:
   - Dedicated channel with specific permissions:
     - Everyone: No access (deny ViewChannel)
     - Restricted role: Can view and send messages
     - Bot: Full access for management
     - Admin roles: Full access
   - Private threads for individual verification cases
   - Initial message with verification instructions
   - Automatic thread creation for flagged new joins
   - Manual thread creation via button or command

### Open Questions & Considerations

1. **Database Schema Design**:

   - Initial schema created with three main tables:
     - servers: Guild configuration storage
     - users: Cross-server user tracking (planned)
     - server_members: User-server relationship (planned)
   - Need to implement repositories for users and server_members
   - Need to design queries for cross-server reputation lookup
   - Consider indexing strategy for performance
   - Plan for data retention and pruning

2. **Performance Optimization**:

   - Server configuration caching implemented
   - Need to implement rate limiting for GPT API calls
   - Consider message queue for high-traffic servers
   - Evaluate memory usage for message history tracking
   - Plan for database connection pooling
   - Consider sharding for very large bot installations

3. **Deployment Strategy**:
   - Need to decide between VPS and serverless hosting
   - Evaluate Docker containerization benefits
   - Plan for environment variable management in production
   - Consider monitoring and alerting solutions
   - Design backup and recovery procedures
   - Plan for zero-downtime updates

## Current Challenges

1. **Balancing Detection Accuracy**:

     - Confidence scoring for transparency
   - Need to tune thresholds based on real-world usage
   - Need to collect feedback on false positives/negatives
   - Need to adapt to evolving spam techniques

2. **Discord API Limitations**:

   - Button interactions expire after 15 minutes
   - Gateway connection requirements for certain events
   - Rate limits for high-traffic operations
   - Slash command registration delays
   - Permission management complexity

3. **Cost Management**:
   - Selective GPT usage strategy implemented
   - Need to monitor and optimize token usage
   - Need to evaluate hosting options for cost-efficiency
   - Need to plan for scaling with increased adoption
   - Consider premium tier options for sustainability
